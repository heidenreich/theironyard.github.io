              <h4>Chief Executive Officer</h4>
              <p>Peter went to Vanderbilt University and studied computer engineering, which naturally led to him becoming an options executive on Wall Street. After the financial markets had worn out their welcome, he packed his family up, moved to Indianapolis and returned to his hacker roots as a software developer and CTO for SinglePoint, Inc. After several other successful startup exits, he moved his family to Greenville, SC, where he helped start NEXT and build the NEXT Innovation Center and founded The Iron Yard. He currently serves as our CEO and is sometimes referred to as &quot;The Iron Barth.&quot;</p>

              <p>Eric was born and raised in Upstate SC, where he spent his early years hiking, mountain biking and dirt bike riding with his dad. Somehow he ended up at Clemson University, where he tutored calculus, studied marketing and matriculated summa cum laude. (We hear there was a lot of wake boarding, too.) After school Eric worked at a nationally renowned marketing shop, where he developed content, managed accounts and built strategies for companies like Best Buy and Doubleday. He crossed paths with Peter as The Iron Yard was being born and jumped ship to join as a partner and head of marketing.</p>

              <h4>Chief Technology Officer</h4>
              <p>Mason was born and raised in Jackson, MS (better known as The Dirty South). He grew up in the woods and, as a result, likes animals, trees and beer. A hacker from the start, he began hacking on software in his early teens. Upon moving back to the USA after four years in Japan, at age 24 he ended a multi-year fast from programming and hit the ground running. Like any good college graduate with a degree in philosophy, he has worked for small, boutique web shops, startups in San Francisco and everywhere in between. Mason serves as our CTO and head of all things pedagogical.</p>

Before she was even halfway through with her degree at the University of South Carolina, she had already joined Peter to help run the first iteration of our Accelerator program when she wasn't in class. On campus she served as Philanthropy Chair then Recruitment Vice President for Alpha Delta Pi (largest chapter in the nation). Every summer since then she has returned to Greenville to keep us straight with her perfect organizational skills, type-A project management skills and her always-wonderful way with people.</p>

Although he used to weigh 300 pounds and make crying babies of Division I defensive linemen, he is now a gentle-hearted husband to his wife, Sarah, father to his pooch, Shakey, and fearless leader of the startup company Ridepost. His superhuman abilities allow him to also serve as the head of all things Accelerator at The Iron Yard. He is learning the art of the home brew, and is an avid fly-fisherman.</p>

During his childhood there wasn't a sport he didn't play, but he eventually he re-directed his passion towards music and taught himself how to play guitar. Jeff spent his early career working in marketing and graphic design, starting out sweeping floors and eventually handling everything from client management to design and production. While on vacation visiting his brother in Spartanburg, he was introduced to Marty and The Iron Yard and his ticket was punched. Only two short weeks after that vacation he packed his bags and headed down south. An avid lover of the outdoors, the nearby Blue Ridge Mountains didn't hurt either.</p>

She has spent most of the past seven years hanging out with developers in various capacities and has even picked up a little code herself.

              <p>Matt is an Oklahama-born, Texas-raised southerner with brief Australian and British residences. He learnt programming in high school but quickly branched into scientific computing, compilers, web development, and computer security. He finally settled with a Computer Science degree from the University of Texas and two security certifications from &quot;the man&quot;. The remaining 90% of Matt's experience was filled with his involvement in two startups; one SXSW campaign; a healthy dose of freelance web development; an opportunity to author a few books; some speaking arrangements at large conferences; and a consulting position that helped to round out his eccentricity with soft-skills, management exposure, and a place in the Houston community. Here at The Iron Yard, Matt works to break down concepts into delicious bite-sized morsels, meant to be enjoyed with crafty beer, memorable memes, and sophisticated southern and British &quot;humour&quot;.</p>

              <h2>Shelby Switzer</h2>
              <h4>Ruby Instructor</h4>
              <p>Shelby Switzer is a language-lover, self-taught programmer, reader, wanderluster, writer, and snow-and-water enthusiast currently eating falafel. While studying Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic at the University of Cambridge (Trinity College), she learned to speak a variety of esoteric and endangered languages, and had amazing opportunities to travel and work across Europe and in Africa. After graduating, she worked at an art gallery in Malaysia and taught English in a small village in the foothills of the Nepali Himalayas. She returned to the states with a passion for both spicy food and getting involved in the startup tech industry as a means for community development, so she became a disciple of Matz and started building with Ruby. Since then, she has worked with a variety of startups in the role of lead backend developer, consultant, and Scoville scale expert. She's beyond stoked to be part of The Iron Yard team and spread the cult (erm, I mean joy) of Ruby.</p>

              <h2>Jesse Wolgamott</h2>
              <h4>Ruby Instructor</h4>
              <p>JWo was not born in Texas, but got here as fast as he could, y’all. (born in Arizona and lived in Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Kenya, and Japan — all before he was 6), and was given access to a computer (8086) soon thereafter. After Dig-Dug, being the only kid in school typing reports and handing in his school reports in Lotus 123, he started to like these computer things. He programmed Perl during Web 1.0, .NET during the bust, and now Ruby and Javascripts. Jesse has been a consultant using open source software stack for 5 years, and is an open source developer and contributor. Jesse has taught Ruby courses since 2012, authored a book on AngularJS+Rails, and has loved Rails since 2007. Jesse has trained and spoke at conferences across the US, and has determined that Tacos rule and salads drool.</p>

              <h4>Teaching Assistant</h4>
              <p>Laura Lindeman is an all-around word nerd: avid reader, blogger, and occasional grammar pedant who has opinions about the Oxford comma. She comes to The Iron Yard after several years of working in the non-profit sector and is excited to translate her organizing skills into empowering the next generation of developers. Laura is a firm believer in the power of community and the ways technology brings people together, though sharing a delicious meal in person is even better. She has a soft spot for cardigans, funky earrings, and chocolate with peanut butter. When she's not writing or helping students with Ruby on Rails, you can often find her backpacking, bargain hunting, or trying out new recipes.</p>

              <h2>Joe Tamburro</h2>
              <h4>Teaching Assistant</h4>
              <p>Joe knew zero about programming before taking The Iron Yard's Front End Engineering class. Now he's a solid hacker and a gifted programming teacher. He graduated from Clemson in 2009 with a B.S. in Business Management. He spent the two years prior to enrolling in our school as a touring drummer in a band based out of Greenville, SC. He loved traveling and being on the road, but towards the end he knew it was time to close that chapter in his life. Here's what he has to say: &quot;I can say without any hesitation that going through with this course was the best decision I have ever made.&quot; We agree...so much so that we kept him around to support Mason as a Teaching Assistant.</p>
