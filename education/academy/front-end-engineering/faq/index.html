<p>Great question. The answer depends on which school you compare us to, so we’ll talk through the most common options people ask about. If you want, you can email Eric—he loves talking about code schools on the phone or in person.</p>

<p><strong>Online resources</strong></p>

<p>We love telling people that you can find almost all of the information in our curriculum online, for free. It’s no secret: “Google University” has produced many a fine programmer. In almost every case, though, their skill was forged over years of experience, trial, error, and learning the hard way how much horrible information and advice there is on the internet. With the ever-increasing technological advances in our digital world, it’s getting even harder to sort the good from the bad. Our course is designed to trim the fat you find online, compress learning time time by showing you the right resources, dive far deeper than most internet tutorials take you, and, most importantly, teach you the intangible elements of great programming (collaborative coding, architecture, workflows, good communication, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>Online code education programs</strong></p>

<p>We’re huge fans of online education. In fact, we’re good friends with the people at Treehouse, and encourage all of our students to sign up so they can expand their knowledge, learn new languages, and continue practicing the art of code. What’s more, most students who come to us have spent time in some sort of online code program and realized that becoming a professional developer in the near future is going to take more than a few hours of tutorials on nights and weekends. What many don’t realize is that most online schools fail to plumb the depths needed in order to be a top-notch developer. Instead of scripted, step-by-step assignments, our exercises focus first on problem solving, meaning students complete the same assignment in a variety of ways. This teaches them the real-world complexity of programming and gives our instructor live examples to teach from.</p>

<p><strong>Offline code schools</strong></p>

<p>There are offline code schools popping up all around the world, and from what we can tell, their quality varies widely. After talking with students from other schools, here are a few things that set our program apart:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Dollar for dollar, we’re the most accessible program out there.</strong> You get a brand new laptop and a job. It doesn’t get much more full service than that. We’ve had students step off of a plane, take a taxi to the housing, use their bike for the semester, and get hired one-week after graduation. Not bad if we say so ourselves.</li>
<li>W<strong>e teach far more than code</strong>, bringing in guest-lecturers who talk about design fundamentals, how to work well with designers, back-end programmers, entrepreneurs, and more.</li>
<li><strong>We place a high value on soft skills</strong>, focusing on the qualitative aspects of being a successful programer, whether that’s in a freelance career or at a company. We give students feedback on their interaction and contribution in group projects, their communication with us during the program, and the strengths and weaknesses they’ll carry into their work. On top of this individualized attention, our team lectures throughout the semester on communication skills, freelance contracts, team dynamics, and more.</li>
<li><strong>Our instructors are practicing professionals</strong>. We give our teachers one month off between each class, and that time is filled with working on real products, learning the latest technology, and incorporating their learnings into the curriculum to keep it bleeding-edge.</li>
<li><strong>Our job-placement is personalized</strong>. Our team works incredibly hard to get students where they want to be, whether that’s a startup or a large corporation. We have contacts all around the country, and after the program we meet weekly with each student to execute a job-searching strategy with them. We also perform mock interviews so that there aren’t any surprises when you graduate.</li>
<li><strong>When appropriate, we give our students paid freelance work before they graduate</strong>. If students have extra bandwidth, we connect them with partner companies who pay cash for contract work, meaning real portfolio work and references when they graduate.</li>
<li><strong>We work on real projects for real people</strong>. Whether it’s an internal tool for The Iron Yard or an actual product our team or one of our Accelerators is building, our students have the chance to work on real live stuff that actual customers will use.</li>
<li><strong>You get access to the entire Iron Yard family</strong>. Whether it’s working shoulder-to-shoulder with our accelerator teams, sitting in on mentor sessions, networking with our CoWorkers, or looking through our Rolodex and asking for introductions, we give you any resource we can to help you be successful.
We partner with awesome sponsors. Our sponsors provide amazing resources to our students, from free accounts to web-design assets. Check them out at the bottom of the page.</li>
</ul>


<h3>You’ll help me find a job?</h3>

<p>If you choose to enroll in the job placement program, we’ll do our darndest to put you where you want to be, and we’re putting our money where our mouth is.</p>

<p>We cannot guarantee the exact salary or location of the job, but if you don’t get an offer in six months, we’ll give you your tuition back. <a href="mailto:academy@theironyard.com?subject:I%20have%20a%20question%20about%20job%20placement">Contact us</a> for more details.</p>

<h3>How much does it cost?</h3>

<p>We strive to make our courses as affordable accessible as possible, providing students with a brand new laptop, housing, and a bike to ride to class. You can fly in, catch a ride from the airport to our apartments, and take our classes without having to worry about where to stay or how to get around.</p>

<p><strong>Tuition</strong><br/>
Base tuition is $9000, and we have significant discounts for enlisted military personnel and veterans, as well as scholarships.</p>

<p><strong>Payment options</strong><br/>
If you pay the full cost of tuition up front, you’ll get a $250 discount. We also offer financing: Pay one-third of the tuition up front and the balance in even payments over six months. If applicable, the cost of housing is spread evenly over the six-month payment period.</p>

<p><strong>Laptop</strong><br/>
Tuition with a laptop included is $1000. This is the absolute cheapest way for our students to get their hands on a brand new MacBook Air. If you want to use your own machine it has to be a recent Apple laptop, with ample processing speed and hard drive space. Not sure if yours qualifies? Give us a shout.</p>

<p><strong>Housing (Greenville, SC only)</strong><br/>
Housing is only available for our Greenville, SC Front End Engineering course. It is $1500 for the three months. We have a block of really nice, fully-furnished apartments that are reserved for our Greenville Academy students year round. We’ve done our research and it’s almost impossible to find cheaper (nice) living if you don’t live in town.</p>

<h3>What do employers say about students they’ve hired?</h3>

<p>Here are quotes from people who have hired our students:</p>

<p><em>“When I hired Andrew McIntee to overhaul a handful of our web properties, I was blown away at how much he had learned from The Iron Yard Academy. We couldn’t be happier.”</em> <br/>
<strong>—Dan Waldschmidt, CEO of Waldschmidt Partners</strong></p>

<p><em>“Tyler has been great. Each project he did had a unique layout and therefore needed a little more care than the templates for the rest of the site. The first week, I had him come in just to test the waters…and I hope to use him weekly/bi-weekly until they’re all live. He has a great personality, easy to talk to and work with. He takes direction well, and offers good solutions and alternative solutions. The markup that he produces is top notch—it was extremely easy for me to go in and make tweaks when I was stitching files together for launch. Overall, I’m really impressed. Can’t wait to see more guys like him come out of the program. Thanks for the recommendation.”</em>
<strong>—Nathan Spainhour, Digital Guru at Brains on Fire</strong></p>

<p><em>“Our latest programmer is an Iron Yard graduate and we’re impressed. She comes to us in learning mode from the academy and is picking up the languages that we need her to use quickly. She’s already added a lot of value and enthusiasm to the development team.”</em> <br/>
<strong>—William Haynes, CEO of Sabai Technology</strong></p>

<h3>What do students say about your classes?</h3>

<p>We’re so glad you asked. We’ll let them tell you themselves:</p>

<p><em>“The Iron Yard has taught me a new way to think, given me confidence to move forward, and opened numerous doors on a path to a fulfilling programming career. Thinking about it? Stop, and just do it.”</em><br/>
<strong>—Daniel Jeffords, Class of April, 2013</strong></p>

<p><em>“I came into the class as a small-time, self-taught web developer, the Iron Yard Academy helped me re-learn how to develop the right way. I can now write production-level code with confidence and collaborate effectively with other programmers. Going to this class taught me how to be a true craftsman of the web, dramatically increased my industry value, and opened up tons of doors for work.”</em><br/>
<strong>—Andrew McIntee, Class of April, 2013</strong></p>

<p><em>“The staff is cool, easily approachable and encourages questions. The workspace and classroom are awesome. Aside from comfy furniture, they have a pool table, an open source video game console but best of all, you can draw on almost every wall in the building.”</em><br/>
<strong>—Ari Picker, Class of August, 2013</strong></p>

<p>Want to talk to a graduate? <a href="mailto:academy@theironyard.com?subject=I'd%20like%20to%20talk%20to%20a%20graduate">Give us a shout</a> and we’ll connect you.</p>
