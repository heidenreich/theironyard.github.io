    <h1 class="name">Peter Barth</h1>
    <p class="bio">Peter went to Vanderbilt University and studied computer engineering, which naturally led to him becoming an options executive on Wall Street. After the financial markets had worn out their welcome, he packed his family up, moved to Indianapolis and returned to his hacker roots as a software developer and CTO for SinglePoint, Inc. After several other successful startup exits, he moved his family to Greenville, SC, where he helped start NEXT and build the NEXT Innovation Center and founded The Iron Yard. He currently serves as our CEO and is sometimes referred to as "The Iron Barth."</p>

    <h1 class="name">Eric Dodds</h1>
    <p class="bio">Eric was born and raised in Upstate SC, where he spent his early years hiking, mountain biking and dirt bike riding with his dad. Somehow he ended up at Clemson University, where he tutored calculus, studied marketing and matriculated summa cum laude. (We hear there was a lot of wake boarding, too.) After school Eric worked at a nationally renowned marketing shop, where he developed content, managed accounts and built strategies for companies like Best Buy and Doubleday. He crossed paths with Peter as The Iron Yard was being born and jumped ship to join as a partner and head of marketing.</p>

  <div class="graduates-right">
    <h1 class="name">Mason Stewart</h1>
    <p class="bio">Mason was born and raised in Jackson, MS (better known as The Dirty South). He grew up in the woods and, as a result, likes animals, trees and beer. A hacker from the start, he began hacking on software in his early teens. Upon moving back to the USA after four years in Japan, at age 24 he ended a multi-year fast from programming and hit the ground running. Like any good college graduate with a degree in philosophy, he has worked for small, boutique web shops, startups in San Francisco and everywhere in between. Mason serves as our CTO and head of all things pedagogical. </p>

On campus she served as Philanthropy Chair then Recruitment Vice President for Alpha Delta Pi (largest chapter in the nation). Every summer since then she has returned to Greenville to keep us straight with her perfect organizational skills, type-A project management skills and her always-wonderful way with people. </p>

    <p class="bio">Marty is not your typical Managing Director. Although he used to weigh 300 pounds and make crying babies of Division I defensive linemen, he is now a gentle-hearted husband to his wife, Sarah, father to his pooch, Shakey, and fearless leader of the startup company Ridepost. His superhuman abilities allow him to also serve as the head of all things Accelerator at The Iron Yard. He is learning the art of the home brew, is an avid fly-fisherman, and bounces between angling Largemouth Bass and Largewallet Investors.</p>

    <h1 class="name">Nick Bucciarelli</h1>
    <p class="bio">Nick viciously pursued a degree in Video Game Development from Full Sail, where he received his bachelor's in two years. He has since switched industries and started developing web applications...and he hasn't looked back. He moved to Charleston, SC, where he began consuming every bit of knowledge he could. While moving up the ranks at Jack Russell Software to become a Senior Developer (from apprentice in only 3.5 years!), he found a love for teaching motivated individuals everything he had to offer and decided to pursue a career in education. He is super excited to teach and share his passion for his craft (web applications) to students at The Iron Yard Academy.</p>

Calvin has taught web development classes to college students and environmental education to K-12 students.  As a developer Calvin has worked with a huge range of companies, from The Charleston Museum to the Veterans Administration and Cummins Marine.

    <p class="bio">Jo started as a designer while studying at the Creative Circus, which has cursed him with the need to critique any and all bad design implementation. After getting a taste of code as a web developer, he found his passion and constantly pushed himself to learn more. That journey led him his true love: building apps for mobile devices. After launching several top-notch iOS apps, he landed at startup HighFive, a mobile rewards platform that tracks user activities and chooses when to offer rewards. His passion for education has never left, though, so he joined our team as an iOS instructor to help others discover the beauty of Objective-C.</p>

  <div class="graduates-right">
    <h1 class="name">Joe Tamburro</h1>
    <p class="bio">Joe knew zero about programming before taking The Iron Yard's Front End Engineering class. Now he's a solid hacker and a gifted programming teacher. He graduated from Clemson in 2009 with a B.S. in Business Management. He spent the two years prior to enrolling in our school as a touring drummer in a band based out of Greenville, SC. He loved traveling and being on the road, but towards the end he knew it was time to close that chapter in his life. Here's what he has to say: "I can say without any hesitation that going through with this course was the best decision I have ever made." We agree...so much so that we kept him around to support Mason as a Teaching Assistant.</p>
