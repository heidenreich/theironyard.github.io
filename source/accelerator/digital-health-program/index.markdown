### From wellness apps to enterprise software, we're helping startups build the future of health.

**Members of our Accelerator Receive:**

*   $20,000 in seed capital.
*   Three months of incredible mentorship and weekly workshops from experts in healthcare innovation, fundraising, UX/UI and development, design, lean startup methodology, team formation and financing.
*   Demo Day exclusive session at Health 2.0, Silicon Valley Fall Conference.
*   Full year of free coworking space surrounded by other innovators.
*   Strong partnerships with industry experts including global medical research institutions, top pharma distributors and leading hospital systems.
*   Free legal services and amazing perks through [GAN](http://gan.co) and [F6S](http://form.jotformpro.com/form/40124712669958 ).  
*   Great downtown housing in the same building as the accelerator and free access to bikes for getting around town.
*   Fun events to introduce you to the Upstate and the surrounding mountains. All work and no play makes Jack a dull entrepreneur.

**Your Team:**

*   Two or more people. We will occasionally take solo founders, but teams are preferred.
*   Company should be software or a software/hardware combination. We also will consider select medical devices, biotech, and life sciences companies.
*   Your team must co-locate at The Iron Yard for the duration of the program.  There's no obligation to stay here, but we'd sure love to have you.
