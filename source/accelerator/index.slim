    h4 We’re interested in building strong, sustainable businesses that add real value to customers' lives.

    p Speaking the same language? We’d love for you to join us. Whether your goal is a Series A round, building a team and bootstrapping, or utilizing Kickstarter, we have a place for you.

    p We run three programs a year, a <a href="digital-health-program">digital health program</a> and an <a href="tech-program">open tech program</a> and a <a href="/accelerator/green-tech">green tech program</a>.

    h4 What makes us different, you ask?

    p It’s a secret sauce with two ingredients:

    p
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">The first is our network of mentors</span>. CEOs and investors are must-haves, but they’re not the only ingredients to success. We partner with specialists in marketing, design, community management, and other disciplines to offer truly well-rounded support.

    p
      <span style="font-weight: bolder;">The second is The Iron Yard community.</span> Along with supportive alumni (in the same town), our program is located in a space that provides coworking for all sorts of professionals, intensive code education, and hosts nationally-known technology and design events.
