    <h1 class="name">Joe VanLeeuwen</h1>
    <p class="bio">I recently graduated from a three-month Front End Engineering course at The Iron Yard. The work in my portfolio represents long hours plugging away at assignments for the class. I titled my final project <a href="http://joe-vanleeuwen.github.io/chess.js">chess.js</a>, and I am most satisfied with this endeavor. Besides hacking away at something that is way over my head, I also enjoy running, especially trail running. My last big race was the Bel Monte 50 Miler back in April of '13. I hope to run a 100 miler some day!</p>

    <h1 class="name">Ryan Ponce</h1>
    <p class="bio"> After five years working at Apple Stores, my brother and I created a small startup called Surprise Co. At the same time, I created my own company called App Shirt Co. I am still working on both. In August 2013, I moved to Greenville, SC to take a 12-week intensive front-end engineering class. There I learned the skills necessary to become a true developer. I am currently looking for a web development position with a progressive, growth-oriented company that offers challenging opportunities and responsibilities with the potential for career advancement. I am willing to relocate for the perfect position.</p>

    <h1 class="name">Tyler Phillips</h1>
    <p class="bio"> Learning how to write code has been an experience unlike anything else. It wasn't simply learning a new skill. It was learning a new way of thinking. I learned to look at all areas of the problem and analyze them before making a decision. This new way of thinking has taught me to look at all problems differently, whether they involve programming or everyday life. As I move forward, I'm excited to continue to grow, learn and continue to improve upon my thinking and problem solving abilities.</p>

    <p class="bio"> I am many things: father of two, programmer/web developer, vocalist, instrument faker, artsy-fartsy, dragon aficionado, cook, and avid cartoon watcher. I find it appealing that there is no level cap in the world of development. Before coming to ​The Iron Yard​, I was constantly coming up with app ideas but unable to act upon them. Now, I create my ideas with my own two hands. The ever-expanding nature of web development means that I'll always have the opportunity to learn. I'm excited to find a job where I can continue to grow as a developer.</p>
