## FAQ

#### Do I need to be in class with my child?

If your child is younger than 13 years old, we require you to be in the class with them. Watch out, because you might just have more fun than they do. 

#### I registered interest in a full class. How will I know if my child gets in?

If a student in a full class drops out before the course starts, we will give their spot to those who registered interest on a first-come-first serve basis. 

#### Do I need to sign any legal paperwork in order for my child to take the class? 

We require every student to have a waiver/release form signed by a parent or guardian. You will recieve a link to this form when you sign up for a ticket.

### Ready to learn?

To sign up for a class, [check our schedule](#schedule) and reserve a ticket. If the class is full, you can sign up for another session or 'register your interest' and we'll add you to the waitlist.
