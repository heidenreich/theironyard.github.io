<p>We&rsquo;re hiring programming instructors and community managers to launch code schools in cities across the Southeast. Check out the open positions below, and be sure to read about our <a href="#mission">mission</a> and <a href="#culture">culture</a>.</p>

<p><a name="instructors"></a></p>

<h2>Programming instructors</h2>

<hr />

<p>We&rsquo;re looking for:</p>

<ul>
<li>iOS instructors</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails instructors</li>
<li>Front end engineering (JavaScript) instructors</li>
</ul>


<p>If you live and breathe code as your craft, find joy in helping other people learn it too, and want a huge amount of time to pursue freelance, personal projects, or open source work, then this job was custom-made for you.</p>

<p><strong>Educational values</strong></p>

<p>First and most importantly, here are a few of our values when it comes to teaching someone how to be a developer:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Thinking over syntax</strong> &ndash; we believe syntax is the easy part of programming, and that we are successful when we&rsquo;ve helped someone learn to think like an engineer</li>
<li><strong>Quality over quantity</strong> &ndash; we&rsquo;re interested in training true professionals, not getting as many people into our classes as possible</li>
<li><strong>Real projects over scripted assignments</strong> &ndash; people learn programming best by tackling hard problems with a mentor, not following a list of steps and taking a quiz</li>
<li><strong>Emphasis on open source</strong> &ndash; we deeply value the open source mindset and intentionally create and contribute to open source projects</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>What the role and responsibilities look like</strong></p>

<p>Our instructors serve as lecturers and mentors to our students, helping them learn to think like engineers and hone their skills in a programming disclipline. You&rsquo;ll also help define and refine the curriculum to stay current with cool new stuff. Here&rsquo;s a peek at the <a href="/education/academy/front-end-engineering">Front End Engineering course</a> we&rsquo;ve already launched.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll teach three, three-month semesters each year. The remaining three months you&rsquo;ll only have light duties for The Iron Yard, such as curriculum updates and interviewing students for future classes. Beyond those things, you&rsquo;re free to work on whatever you want (such as personal projects, open source projects, or products that we&rsquo;re buildling and launching as The Iron Yard). And, of course, you&rsquo;ll want to take some well-deserved time off.</p>

<p>Each class will be 15 students (no more), and you will have an admin/community manager to take care of all the non-teaching-critical parts of running a program.</p>

<p>Outside of teaching responsibilities, you&rsquo;ll be an active part of the development community in your city (hopefully you already are).</p>

<p><strong>Your qualities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Self-starter who takes ownership of your job role</li>
<li>Expertise (and lots of experience) in either JavaScript, Ruby/Rails, or mobile dev (iOS or Android)</li>
<li>GitHub credibility (evidence of an active passion for development)</li>
<li>Great communication skills, especially in distilling complex subject matter</li>
<li>You believe in our <a href="#mission">mission</a> and are excited about building our <a href="#culture">culture</a></li>
<li>Really care about the mission of filling the gigantic developer shortfall happening in our industry</li>
<li>A good sense of humor &ndash; intensive classes don&rsquo;t work if its all work and no play</li>
<li>Big fan of open source work and building the dev community in general</li>
<li><em>Bonus: great at finding epic gifs</em></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Compensation and benefits</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Competitive, full-time developer salary</li>
<li>Profit sharing</li>
<li>Ample time to pursue personal projects, open source work, and more between semesters</li>
<li>100% paid benefits</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Sound like a dream come true?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>What you&rsquo;ll teach (iOS, RoR, or JS)</li>
<li>Where you live and whether you are willing to relocate</li>
<li>A link to your GitHub profile</li>
<li>Portfolio or examples of work and</li>
<li>Your favorite gif</li>
</ul>


<p><a name="community-managers"></a></p>

<h2>Community managers</h2>

<hr />

<p>If you are passionate about education, people, being creative and keeping things organized, you&rsquo;ve found your home.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re looking for people to be the voices, faces and hands of our code schools in each new city we launch.</p>

<p><strong>What the role and responsibilities look like</strong></p>

<p>Our people in this role build community, both internally and externally, work with the instructors to manage applications and admissions, and make sure our spaces are awesome places to learn and work (that means stylish furniture and decor, finding the best locally roasted coffee available, and keeping office supplies in stock).</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll be networking with potential students and employers, getting out into the community to represent The Iron Yard, hosting rockin&#8217; events for our students and others, and more. Leading up to and after graduation you&rsquo;ll help students get their resumes and portfolios job-ready, and work with them to find and apply for jobs.</p>

<p>The best part of the job is getting to know students and playing a role in helping them pursue a life and career that they are truly passionate about.</p>

<p><strong>Your qualities</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Self-starter who takes ownership of your job role (if you need to be micro-managed, this isn&rsquo;t the place for you)</li>
<li>Loves meeting people, networking, and making connections</li>
<li>Organized and pays attention to detail</li>
<li>Enjoys communicating on social media</li>
<li>You believe in our <a href="#mission">mission</a> and are excited about building our <a href="#culture">culture</a></li>
<li>Really care about making a difference in our broken edcucation system</li>
<li>A good sense of humor</li>
<li><em>Bonus: enjoy and are good at creating content and writing</em></li>
<li><em>Bonus, but not at all required: you&rsquo;ve got some hacking skills</em></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Compensation and benefits</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Competitive full-time salary</li>
<li>Profit sharing</li>
<li>100% paid benefits</li>

<h2>Our mission</h2>

<hr />

<p>The world has huge problems that need to be solved, many of which technology is perfectly suited to address. Companies full of designers and developers around the globe are answering this call, but there&rsquo;s a problem: there aren&rsquo;t enough of them. While data shows a current surplus of American graduates with STEM degrees, anyone on the ground in the tech industry has felt the acute shortage of high-quality developers. What&rsquo;s more, over the next 10 years there will be <em>1.4 million jobs in computer science but only 400,000 qualified graduates</em>.</p>

<p>The Iron Yard is a solution at that juncture of supply, demand, and a broken education system. We are committed to training up the highest-quality developers in the world, both in skill and in character. Our mission is to find people who want to pursue the <em>craft</em> and <em>life-long adventure</em> of programming, teach them the tools of the trade, teach them how to teach themselves, and then release them into the world with the drive and capability to make a difference. We believe that passionate, talented people who love what they do will create great families, jobs, companies, and solutions to the world&rsquo;s problems.</p>

<p>We want to accomplish this alongside talented, passionate people who share our vision, love what they do, and want to have a whole lot of fun along the way.</p>

<p><a name="culture"></a></p>

<h2>Our culture</h2>

<hr />

<p>If you walk into The Iron Yard on any given afternoon, you&rsquo;re as likely to see an engineering team architecting software as you are to see a group enjoying craft brews over ping pong and video games.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been told we&rsquo;re a &ldquo;work hard, play hard&rdquo; crew, and we couldn&rsquo;t agree more. Our standards for producing awesome stuff are extremely high, but so is our capacity to truly enjoy life alongside the people we work with.</p>

<p>Here are a few characteristics of how we work:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>People first, always</em> &ndash; We absolutely love what we get to do everyday, but more importantly we&rsquo;re passionate about <em>who we get to do it with</em> and the entrepreneurs and students we get to serve—they&rsquo;re the reason we come to work.</li>
<li><em>Flat structure and highly entrepreneurial</em> &ndash; We don&rsquo;t manage people, we give them a goal and let them use their skills to accomplish it in the best way possible. This can be difficult if you like a lot of structure and daily direction. For the self-starter types, though, it&rsquo;s vocational bliss.</li>
<li><em>Open mindset</em> &ndash; The Iron Yard is an open place for people of all kinds; we don&rsquo;t believe in molds, stereotypes, or any sort of discrimination. Also, we don&rsquo;t believe in artificial scarcity—if we can help someone, we will. If a project can have a bigger impact being open-sourced, we&rsquo;ll open source it.</li>
<li><em>&lsquo;Being home for dinner&rsquo; policy</em> &ndash; We work <em>really</em> hard, but a constantly imbalanced life isn&rsquo;t healthy for anyone. We work fast, efficient, and fun so that we can invest in important areas of life outside the office.</li>
</ul>
